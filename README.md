## Why Capture

- **Never miss the moment.** Capture keeps the last 15 seconds to 20 minutes (5 by default) on your disk or in RAM. Press `Alt+F10` and it becomes a clip.
- **Smart Save.** Record a phrase of your own, in any language, then just say it to save a clip or take a screenshot. It runs offline.
- **Light.** It records on your graphics card. Measured while a game ran at 1440p60 AV1: 0.4% CPU, no dropped frames.
- **Edit in place.** Cut, change the speed, add text, draw, blur, and make auto captions on your own PC.
- **Share in one press.** Post to X, TikTok and Instagram, or all three at once with one caption, or copy the clip and paste it anywhere.
- **Private.** No account, no telemetry. Your clips stay on your PC until you share them.

## Download

1. Download **Capture-Setup.exe** from the [latest release](https://github.com/yasirmz/Capture/releases/latest).
2. Run it and follow the steps: pick your language and the folder (no administrator rights needed), and whether you want a desktop shortcut and Capture to start with Windows.
3. Play, then press `Alt+F10` when something happens.

Windows may warn about an unknown publisher (the installer is not signed yet): choose **More info**, then **Run anyway**.
Updates come from inside the app, and never during a recording. Uninstalling keeps your clips and settings.

**Needs:** Windows 10 (2004 or newer) or Windows 11, 64-bit. A graphics card with a video encoder (NVIDIA, AMD or Intel) is recommended.

## Features

<details>
<summary>Everything Capture does</summary>

- **Capture:** full screen, up to 5 apps (the one in front is recorded), or games (picked up automatically, stretched and exclusive fullscreen too), up to 4K at 30 to 240 fps.
- **Instant replay:** up to 20 minutes, on your disk (SSD or HDD) or in RAM, a quick clip beside it, and if you like a fresh start after each save.
- **Automatic quality:** Capture picks the encoder, size, frame rate and quality your PC records best with, and steps down by itself if frames are skipped.
- **Encoding:** AV1, HEVC or H.264 on NVIDIA (NVENC), AMD (AMF) or Intel (Quick Sync); if one cannot start, the next one records, down to x264.
- **Audio:** a mixer with a row per source (game, Discord, music, microphone, any app or device), each with its own level and, if you like, its own track.
- **Camera:** your webcam or phone in a corner (square or round) or on top of a 9:16 picture, and if you like saved on its own.
- **Recording:** start, pause and stop with hotkeys; a paused recording stays one file.
- **Screenshots** with their own hotkey, saved beside your clips.
- **Library:** clips and screenshots by day, filtered by game; drag a clip straight into Discord; a folder size limit; save to OneDrive, Dropbox or Google Drive and free the local copies.
- **Editor:** cut and join, speed and sound per part (every track), zoom into an area, text in many fonts and styles, auto captions, drawing, shapes, blur, filters, and crop for screenshots.
- **Auto captions:** Whisper on your graphics card. The engine and model are downloaded once, after you agree, and can be removed in Settings.
- **Share:** X, TikTok, Instagram, or all of them, through each site's own page; Copy made to fit Discord's 10, 50 or 500 MB; trim on a frame strip and crop to 9:16; copies kept in your clips folder's Shared.
- **Help:** Save a report on the Status page puts the logs and settings in a zip on your Desktop, to attach to a GitHub issue.
- **Seven languages:** English, Arabic, Chinese, Russian, Spanish, Portuguese and German. The first run follows your Windows language.
- **Quiet:** starts with Windows in the tray, with no pop-ups or sounds unless you turn them on.

## Privacy

- No telemetry, no analytics, no Capture account.
- Capture goes online only to check GitHub for a newer version once a day and download it (you can turn that off), to post what you share through each site's own page, and to download auto captions once, after you agree (the engine from GitHub, the model from Hugging Face).
- Your clips stay in your clips folder (synced only if you pick a OneDrive, Dropbox or Google Drive folder), and your settings and logs on your PC. Smart Save and auto captions listen on your PC only, and your Smart Save phrase is recorded there only.
- Site sign-ins stay in Capture's own browser on your PC (Microsoft Edge WebView2, protected by Windows as in Edge), never in Capture's settings or logs. Signing out of a site also signs out of the Google, Apple or Facebook account used for it.
- **Save a report** holds Capture's logs and settings without your Windows user name or window titles, and never sign-ins or clips.
- Found a security problem? Please report it privately: see [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).

## FAQ

**Is Capture safe with anti-cheat?**

Capture never reads or changes a game's memory. To capture a game that fills the screen (in every mode, so a stretched or exclusive fullscreen game is never black), it uses the same signed, anti-cheat-compatible capture hook as OBS Studio, which Riot Vanguard, Easy Anti-Cheat and BattlEye allow. If a game ever gives no picture through the hook, Capture records the screen instead by itself, so a clip is never black.

**Does a yellow border show while recording?**

Not on Windows 11. On Windows 10, Windows itself draws a yellow border around the app in **Apps** mode and gives apps no way to hide it; **Full screen** and **Games** never show one.

**My clips stutter above 60 fps.**

A clip can't be smoother than your screen or your game: recording 144 fps on a 60 Hz screen repeats frames unevenly. Capture says so under the frame rate, and **Automatic** in Quality never records above your screen's rate. 60 suits YouTube, X, TikTok and Instagram.

**Something doesn't work. What do I send?**

Press **Save a report** on the Status page: a zip with Capture's logs and settings lands on your Desktop. Attach it to a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/yasirmz/Capture/issues).

## Build from source

<details>
<summary>For developers</summary>

Capture is a .NET 10 app (WPF and WinForms) that hosts **libobs**, the engine of [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com), with only the modules it needs, and uses FFmpeg for editing and sharing.

```powershell
.\tools\build-whisper.ps1               # once: the auto captions engine (needs the Vulkan SDK and VS Build Tools)
.\tools\release.ps1                     # the Setup, update files and source zip in releases\ (needs vpk 1.2.161)
dotnet run --project tests\Capture.Tests # the tests
```

The build copies libobs 32.2.2 from an installed OBS Studio.
